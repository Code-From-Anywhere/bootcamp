# Internship Code From Anywhere

Interested in working in a job where you have all the freedom in the world? Do you have high ambitions and do you want to take your programming to the next level? Then this is the perfect internship for you!

# 💼 About Code From Anywhere

We're a Software development agency from The Netherlands that builds software for software developers all around the world. We're inventing our own ideal work style and that's why we are called "Code From Anywhere". If you join this company, your work can be done location independent. We love adventure and traveling and we are building a movement for developers from all over the world that love this too.

# 🚀 The Challenge

When you join us you will first learn the basics of our own tech-stack called SensibleStack, which basically is Full-Stack typed Javascript (typescript). After learning our ways you will get small assignments that can be done indepenently (and from anywhere). After a couple iterations your work will be deployed and used by many other developers in our products.

# 🌏 🏔 🏝 Travel

We organise bootcamps all around the world. The next one will be held high in the Himalayas of Nepal from September '22 onwards. If you can join, you have a much better environment to learn quickly and also a much bigger chance of getting a job with us afterwards.

# ✅ Who are we looking for

- You need to have good communications skills and you are able to take responsibility
- You need to be entrepreneurial and be curious about learning new things
- You are open to being challenged every day
- If you love travel and adventure, you're almost already in!

# 🤝 What do we offer

There is no pay for this internship. However, we are going to teach you to become a full stack developer, for free! You can also choose yourself how many hours you want to commit to this. The minimum is 24 hours a week if you want to get coaching and attend to the course lessons.

After you get enough experience and are able to produce usable, elegant code, it's possible to apply for a paid job here at Code From Anywhere!
