Rules:

- If you're new, please introduce yourself
- If you don't post your progress report for more than a week or if you don't join the meetings, you will be kicked out of this channel, this way we keep it a small and active group
- Speak only English in this channel
- Try and help others with the things you learned, this is a great way to learn also
- Feel free to have meetings together, online co study sessions can also be very effective
