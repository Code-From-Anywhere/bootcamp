You and only you are liable for what happens to your laptop (and any other gear). laptops are not built for the environment where we are staying. The altitude and temperature shifts can reduce your laptop lifespan. It is up to you how you are using it, but as a general rule, don't wake your laptop when its temperature has been and still is below 10 degrees.

You are not guaranteed a job.

You are participating in the bootcamp independently and you are the only one responsible for everything that happens to you.

You joined the bootcamp out of free will and there is no company/enterprise who facilitated this. We are just a group of programmers doing the same thing (one of which happens to know a bit more about typescript than the others).

Make sure you have a linux based OS installed on your laptop before joining. If you have windows, it will be harder for you to do everything.
