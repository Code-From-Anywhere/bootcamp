This is a good convention for a progress report:

how many hours have you spend coding this week?

what have you learned?

- 1
- 2
- 3

what do you need help with?

- 1
- 2
- 3

what are your next steps?

- 1
- 2
- 3

simply copy-paste this format and answer these questions at least once per week (edited)
