way of working

- remove all apps from your computer except the required tools for programming
- disconnect from the internet
- no phones
- only data formats allowed: md, csv, json, ts(x), png, mp3, mp4 (make sure to migrate to this using the migration tools)
- have your computer on a rope so you can easily take it with you (i'll provide). this makes it possible to have interactive audio material available at all times, also on the go
