This bootcamp will be held in the summer in the Netherlands. This bootcamp is held in july and august on the island of Schiermonnikoog. There is kitesurfing here too.

There is also an option to get a farm anywhere else in the Netherlands. if we do this we may be able to rent it cheaply from a friend. If we can do this in Groningen, my family and friends can visit, which is great after I have traveled the biggest chunk of the year.

Regardless of the exact location, my friends and family will visit much faster in a bootcamp in the netherlands.
